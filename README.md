# Guest Parking Permit Generator for Off-Campus Housing

This project is a guest parking permit generator for off-campus housing that uses physical, printed, guest parking temporary permits. It allows you to generate parking passes independently from the official housing system, giving you flexibility and convenience.

## Features

- **Easy Form Submission**: Fill out the required fields for your guest's vehicle information, set the expiration date, and download a PDF with the parking permit.
- **Expiration Date Flexibility**: Unlike the original system that automatically sets the expiration date, this tool allows you to select when the permit expires.
- **No Limit Notifications**: Some housing systems limit the number of guest parking permits you can generate per month (e.g., 8 passes). This tool allows you to bypass these notifications and limits.
- **No Abuse Notifications**: Certain systems notify management of permit generation, with the potential for consequences (e.g., vehicle towing for misuse). This tool avoids sending such notifications.

## How to Use

1. Navigate to the parking permit tab for the permit type you want to create.
2. Fill out the required form fields with guest and vehicle information.
3. Set the expiration date and time (you can even set it for a future date!).
4. Download the generated PDF and print it out for use.
5. Done! The permit is ready to be printed and displayed on your guest‚Äôs vehicle.

## Why Use This Tool?

Many off-campus housing systems restrict the number of guest parking permits or impose strict monitoring policies. With this generator:
- You bypass the limits imposed by some housing systems (e.g., 8 guest passes per month).
- No notifications are sent to management when you generate a guest pass, so you don‚Äôt need to worry about being penalized for system abuse.
- You can adjust the expiration date to suit your needs, allowing for more flexibility when managing guest parking.

### Added Benefits

- **Flexible Expiration Dates**: The official system typically sets the expiration date to one day after the permit is generated. With this tool, you can select your expiration date, giving you the flexibility to plan ahead or adjust for specific situations.
- **Generate Future Permits**: If you know in advance that you will need a guest permit, you can generate a permit for a future date and print it out ahead of time.

## Tips for Use

- **Avoid Suspicion**: Do not leave a parking permit on the vehicle for multiple days. Although this tool allows you to extend the expiration date, it‚Äôs best to avoid drawing suspicion from management. Real permits typically don‚Äôt last more than a day, so try to limit the expiration period to a few hours or a single day.
- **Plan Ahead**: If you know you will need a guest parking permit for a specific date in the future, generate the pass in advance and print it out. This can be particularly helpful if you won‚Äôt have access to a printer on the day you need the pass.

## Disclaimer

This tool is designed for convenience, but please be mindful of any local parking regulations or rules imposed by your housing management. Use it responsibly to avoid penalties or issues with your housing provider.
